## Abstract
The original goal of this project was the create and train an AI to play as Jack the Ripper in the board game *Whitehall Mystery*, which was created by Fantasy Flight games and originally published in 2017. That goal shifted to building the foundation of the board game, to prepare to create an AI that will eventually be able to play as Jack.

Users should be able to play the game by simply running HiddenMovement.py and then typing runGame(). Prompts will indicate when players should input their choices regarding movement and actions, while also reporting any milestones Jack has reached.

## Planning
Currently, users will need Python to use this program. It would also be helpful and desirable for users to have access to a physical copy of the game. This would allow users to input their movements into the program and then update their board to reflect any information from Jack's movements.

The goals of this project include:
- Inputting relevant data from the game board into dictionaries for use in the game.
- Implementing functions to allow the game to be played by users. At this step, Jack's movements would be random.
- Training a neural net to output Jack's movements, based on relevent data, including Jack's current location, Jack's goal for his next Discovery Location, and the locations of the investigators. Unfortunatly, this goal has not yet been accomplished.

Team:
- Emily is the sole teammate, and thus kept track of progress, updated Git, and worked on the project.
- Lucy is the mentor of this project and provided guidence throughout.
