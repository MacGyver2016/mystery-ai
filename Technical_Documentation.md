## Abstract
The original goal of this project was the create and train an AI to play as Jack the Ripper in the board game *Whitehall Mystery*, which was created by Fantasy Flight games and originally published in 2017. That goal shifted to building the foundation of the board game, to prepare to create an AI that will eventually be able to play as Jack.

Users should be able to play the game by simply running HiddenMovement.py and then typing runGame(). Prompts will indicate when players should input their choices regarding movement and actions, while also reporting any milestones Jack has reached.
