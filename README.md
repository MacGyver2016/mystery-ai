Inclusive Coding Festival Project: Using AI to play a hidden movement board game

## Progress
Currently, this project allows you to play the board game *Whitehall Mystery* as the
investigators, while Jack's movements are randomized.

## Goal
The goal for this project is to create an AI that will control Jack's movements.

## Quick Start
'''python
runGame()
'''
This should allow you to start playing immediately.
There will be prompts for inputs.

## Reference
This project is based off of the *Whitehall Mystery* board game.
